# Waypost's Server-Side SDK for Javascript
## Setup
1. Install via `npm install waypost-sdk-js-server` (https://www.npmjs.com/package/waypost-sdk-js-server)
2. Set up a middleware before your routes that imports the `waypost-sdk-js-server` package, and configures the SDK client (follow the following steps):
3. In the `Config` constructor, the first argument is your SDK key (get this from the Waypost feature flag manager interface). The second argument is the address of Waypost's flag provider service.
Chain the `connect()` method immediately, which sets up the connection to the Waypost flag provider service, and returns the SDK Client containing the feature flag data. Note that the `connect()` method is async, so you will need to `await` it.
4. To add the user_id or any other identifier (such as session_id) to the SDK, which will assign the treatment, use the `addContext()` method on the `sdkClient`, passing in an object containing the key `userId` and the value. Example:
```
sdkClient.addContext({ userId: userId });
```
5. Assign the resulting `sdkClient` object to `req.sdkClient`. This will ensure that all request handlers will have access to the `sdkClient` which will evaluate feature flags for you.

Example:
```
app.use(async (req, res, next) => {
  const Config = require("waypost-sdk-js-server");
  const sdkClient = await new Config('1a2b3d4e', "http://localhost:5050").connect();
  req.sdkClient = sdkClient;
  next();
});
```
## Usage
Wherever you need to branch your code based on the feature flag status, call the `evaluateFlag()` method on `req.sdkClient`.

Example:
```
const useNewPaymentFlag = sdkClient.evaluateFlag("New Payment Feature");
if (useNewPaymentFlag) {
  newPaymentProcessor();
} else {
  oldPaymentProcessor();
}
```
